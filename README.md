## Overview

GAWG (GitHub Actions Workflow Generator) is a comprehensive solution designed to simplify the setup and management of CI/CD workflows in GitHub Actions. The project aims to streamline the process of creating and configuring workflows by leveraging a suite of custom-developed actions and a user-friendly web interface.

# More about GAWG

## How It Works

GAWG integrates several key components to provide a seamless experience for automating CI/CD pipelines:

### Custom GitHub Actions

At the core of GAWG are a series of custom-developed GitHub Actions that handle various stages of the CI/CD process. These actions are designed to:

- **Validate Configurations**: Ensure that all required configurations are correctly set up.
- **Build**: Compile and package your application according to the specified technology (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.).
- **Test**: Run automated tests to validate the correctness of your application.
- **Quality**: Analyze code quality and integrate with SonarCloud for advanced code analysis.
- **Deploy**: Deploy your application to various environments (e.g., EKS, DockerHub, S3).
- **Notify**: Send notifications to your chosen messaging platform (Slack, Discord, Email, etc.).
- **Release**: Manage versioning and releases of your application.

### Web Interface

GAWG features a React-based web application that allows users to easily configure their CI/CD pipelines. The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing a streamlined experience for setting up workflows. Users can fill out a form with necessary details, such as:

- Repository full name
- Technology stack (Java, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Deployment type
- Notification preferences

### Backend and Database

The backend of the GAWG web application is built using AWS services, which handle webhook events and process user configurations. The data is stored in a DynamoDB database, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### Configuration

Once the form is filled out and submitted, the GAWG system automatically generates a GitHub Actions workflow file tailored to your specifications. This workflow file, along with the `sonar-project.properties` and `workflow_config.yml`, is then used to set up and manage your CI/CD pipelines.

### Getting Started

To get started with GAWG, follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/alvarogarciapiz/gawg/wiki/installation-guide) and configure your GitHub repository using the generated workflow files. For detailed information on how to use GAWG, refer to the [Usage Documentation](https://github.com/alvarogarciapiz/gawg/wiki/Usage-(If-you-have-filled-the-website-form)).
